### Application has two endpoints: 

1. **Summarization Endpoint:** It takes in the weekly report from all the employees and summarize all of them into one report by highlighting the key points.

2. **Q/A Endpoint:** A generic question answering endpoint that can answer any questions by looking at the context of the report. With Q/A endpoint, you can do a lot of things. Just think of any question you would ask your personal assistant who has read these reports, now you can directly ask those questions to an AI! and get to the point responses.
